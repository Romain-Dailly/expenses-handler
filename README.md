## Environment

Set values of your TOKEN and APIKEY in `environment.example.ts` and then change the file name to `environment.ts` for developpment purpose.
For production build, copy the content of the file in `environment.prod.ts`.
For currency conversion to euros API, create an account on `https://free.currconv.com/`, and add your api key to the `environment.ts` file in `CURRENCYCONVERTER_APIKEY` property.
You can set the number of expenses per page in `DEFAULT_NUMBER_EXPENSES_PER_PAGE` and the offset for request in `DEFAULT_OFFSET`.

### API calls

#### External calls to API
To call API during developpment, because of CORS in browsers, if you're not locally developping the project, use a proxy.
Change the `proxy.config.example.json` in root folder to `proxy.config.json` and set API_URL in `environment.ts` file to `'/api'`.

#### Local calls to API
To call the API just set the API_URL in `environment.ts`.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
To use the proxy, run `npm run sp` command.

## Code scaffolding
